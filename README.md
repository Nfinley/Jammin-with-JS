# Jammin-with-JS
The beginnings of a book to teach JS using fun memorable characters

This is a project that came about during the course of a coding Bootcamp. It is from the minds of Matthew Holland and Nigel Finley all while studying for class. We thought that it would be really great to have a book (oe e-book) that would be a fun read all while learning javascript. 

Enjoy!
